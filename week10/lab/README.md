# GANs Lab
In this lab, you will create images of people who resemble celebrities. We are using the [Celeb-A Faces dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) and referencing code created by Nathan Inkawhich <https://github.com/inkawhich>.

Load the Python Notebook from Github (dcgan_faces.ipynb) into Colab. Ensure that your runtime is using a GPU.

Follow the notebook to create a set of celebrity faces. Observe how the Generator and Discriminator neural networks are built. Discuss differences between the two neural network designs.
