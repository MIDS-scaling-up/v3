# HW 1: Setting up workspace with Hugging Face ðŸ¤—

This is just a warm-up, things will get harder soon ;-) As a result of this homework, we want you to get comfortable with Hugging Face ðŸ¤— environment so that over the next week you can use it as a platform for building, training/fine-tuning, deploying and running your models. 

## 1. HuggingFaces account
Create an account on HuggingFaces portal, unless you already have one.

## 2. Google Colab
1. If you are note yet familiar with Google Colab, check out https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb
2. Follow steps from https://huggingface.co/course/chapter0/1?fw=pt to make sure that your environment is working
 
## 3. Transformer models
1. If you don't have prior familiarity with transformers, read through the materials at https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1?fw=pt
2. Comlete quiz at https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/10?fw=pt

## 4. Hugging Face ðŸ¤— interface
1. Pick one of demos that are hosted on HuggingFaces platform. Suggestion: https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion
2. Play with different kinds of inputs and critically think about the results of inference (for example, when you provide certain prompt and it generates output images, is it what you expected to see? why and why not? does this hint about potential biases of the model? what are limitations of testing the model via this UI? etc.)

## 5. Papers With Code
1. Explore https://paperswithcode.com/. Understand how the portal is structured, navigation, content curation, etc.
2. Compare and contrast the organization of HuggingFace and PapersWithCode. What would you be using each for? How do they commpliment each other for a data scientist?

To turn in, submit a pdf of your 3.2 quiz results and a free-text summary of your 4.2 exercise (no page limit, you're fine as long as the mini-report shows that you have a good understanding of what the model is supposed to do and what it actually did on the samples that you provided to it). For extra points, submit your thoughts on 5.2!
