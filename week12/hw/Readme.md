# Homework 12.  NLP and Speech

Due: beginning of week 13.

Please complete labs 4,5 and submit your answers / notebooks.

Optional: set up the training on QuartzNet on librispeech from scratch and train for a few epochs.  Note that Nemo has a script for downloading librispeech automatically, so you don't have to.

Credit / nocredit only.  Please spend time on your final projects!!
